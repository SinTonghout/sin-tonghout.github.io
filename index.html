        Traditional Khmer clothing is both beautiful and functional. The styles
        have been shaped by Cambodia’s hot tropical climate, as well as its
        cultural traditions. Both men and women wear loose, lightweight clothing
        made of natural fibers and natural material like cotton or silk. Bright
        colors and intricate details showcase the skill of Khmer weavers and
        tailors. The most wellknown traditional garment is the sampot, a
        wrap-around lower garment worn by both men and women. The sampot
        phamoong, worn by women, is a rectangular fabric wrapped around the
        waist and pinned at the top to create a skirt. Men wear the sampot kben,
        which is tucked in and held up by a belt called a krama. The sampot
        comes in colorful checkered patterns or colorfu floral silk brocades.

        The sampot chang kben is a full, ankle-length skirt. It’s made of silk
        and decorated with floral or geometric patterns. Women wear this for
        special occasions like weddings or festivals. The sampot chang phnom is
        a knee-length cotton skirt. It’s more casual and worn for everyday
        activities. The sampot is wrapped around the waist and secured in place
        with a belt called a kroma.

        A kroma is a checkered scarf that serves many purposes in Khmer
        clothing. Women use it as a belt to hold the sampot in place. Men wear
        the kroma around their waist or neck. The kroma also has many practical
        uses, like as a towel, basket, or hammock. They come in red, blue or
        green checkered patterns.

        The Angkor shirt is a loose-fitting silk or cotton button-down shirt.
        It’s worn by both men and women, and often paired with trousers or a
        sampot. Angkor shirts feature delicate embroidery especially around the
        collar and cuffs. They are popular souvenirs for tourists visiting
        Cambodia.
